# Spell-Mastery---Game-Prototype
Prototype for an action rpg with a modular spell system. Completely created from scratch on my phone with ACode and Javascript.

The core of the project is an GameObject Component System that is distributed over Scenes which get rendered to an Html canvas.
Check out the Architecture PDF for a general overview of the Project.
